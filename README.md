In today's fast-paced world, where air travel has become a common choice, predicting flight fares accurately is essential. The cost of flying is influenced by various factors, making it challenging for travelers. Our project aims to address this issue by implementing machine learning algorithms to provide a reliable flight fare prediction system.



### **What We Offer**

#### **Simplified Flight Fare Predictions**

- üß† **Machine Learning Magic**: We use advanced machine learning techniques, including the Random Forest Algorithm (RF) and Decision Tree Algorithm (DT), to predict flight fares accurately. These models are designed from the ground up to ensure precise predictions.

- üåç **Comprehensive Data**: Our dataset includes over 10,000 records from diverse domestic Indian airlines and meticulously curated information from Domestic Nepali airlines. This wealth of data enables us to provide reliable predictions for various routes and airlines.Indian dataset is taken from [Kaggle Indian Air data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh) 

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Efficiency Matters**: We've conducted a model showdown, comparing RF and DT in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. This ensures that you receive the best predictions in the shortest possible time.

### Personalized Travel Planning

- ‚úàÔ∏è **Customized Journey Planning**: Share your travel plans with us, including departure and arrival dates, source, destination, stopovers, and airline name. We'll instantly reveal the perfect flight fare options tailored to your adventure.

- üíª **User-Friendly Interface**: Our web interface, designed using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap, makes navigation a breeze. No technical expertise required‚Äîjust input your details, and we'll handle the rest.

- üë§ **User Accounts**: Register and log in to enjoy a personalized experience. Gain access to your flight fare prediction history, making it easy to track and compare different options.

### User History Log
